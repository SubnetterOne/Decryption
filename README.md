## Glossary of Resources:

### Gallery3d v13.1.05.8 decryption keys (Android)
*Gallery3d databases were identified to contain string values encoded in base64 + XOR. The keys to decode these values are hard-coded into the APK version file and can be obtained using an APK decompiler such as the [JADX](https://github.com/skylot/jadx) application. Gallery3d versions can be obtained from sources such as [MirrorAPK](https://www.apkmirror.com).* 

*Please be sure to validate file hashes when dealing with third party downloads!*

*The keys extracted from [v13.1.05.8](https://github.com/SubnetterOne/Decryption/blob/main/Gallery3d%20v13.1.05.8) of the Gallery3d application have been saved in this repository in the form of a Python byte array.*
